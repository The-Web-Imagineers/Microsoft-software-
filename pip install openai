2. **Open the app**: Tap the Google Maps app icon on your home screen to open it.
3. **Search for a location**: Type the name of the location you want to find in the search bar at the top of the screen. You can also use voice commands to search for a location by tapping the microphone icon in the search bar.
4. **Get directions**: Once you've found the location you're looking for, tap the "Directions" button at the bottom of the screen. Enter your starting location and tap "Go" to get directions to your destination.
5. **Explore the map**: You can zoom in and out of the map by pinching your fingers together or spreading them apart. You can also drag the map to move around and explore different areas.
